C - Bit manipulation
Look for the right source of information without too much help
How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

TASK 0
	Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
	Return: the converted number, or 0 if
	there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
	b is NULL

TASK 1
	Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
	Format: see example
	You are not allowed to use arrays
	You are not allowed to use malloc
	You are not allowed to use the % or / operators

TASK 2
	Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
	where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get
	Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured

TASK 3
	Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
	where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
	Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred
	
TASK 4
	Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
	where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
	Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

TASK 5
	Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
	You are not allowed to use the % or / operators

TASK 6
	Write a function that checks the endianness.
	Returns: 0 if big endian, 1 if little endian

TASK 7
	Find the password for this program.
	Save the password in the file 101-password
	Your file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
